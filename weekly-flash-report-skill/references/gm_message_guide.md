# Message to GM — Writing Guide

## Core Philosophy

The GM message should tell the GM something they **can't already see** in the report tables. It should interpret trends, surface cross-metric tensions, and give one clear action. Never recap what's already visible.

---

## Structure: **Headline → Story → Ask**

### Beat 1: The Headline (1 sentence)

Open with the **single most important narrative** the GM needs to hear. The headline must be **trend-aware** — a store can have negative comps but still be on its best multi-month run. Lead with the trajectory, not just the PY comparison.

| ❌ Misleading | ✅ Trend-aware |
|---|---|
| "Challenging week — negative comps at -2.2%." | "Strongest sales week since December at $52.7K — PY comps are still negative but the momentum this week is real." |
| "Sales were up 4.2% this week." | "3 straight weeks of growth — your longest positive run since September." |
| "Labor was over guideline." | "Wednesday alone drove the bulk of this week's labor overage — that's your highest-leverage scheduling fix." |

**Key rule**: Always check the multi-week sales trajectory before writing the headline. A store trending UP with negative comps is a different story than a store trending DOWN with negative comps.

**Historical grounding**: Pull ~6 months of weekly sales history to give streak and milestone callouts real context. Say "longest growth run since October" or "strongest week since December" — not vague references like "in the trailing 4 weeks" or "in our data window."

If a streak can't be grounded historically (e.g., a newer store), keep it simple and forward-looking: "4 straight weeks of sales growth — keep up the momentum!"

### Beat 2: The Story (2–3 sentences)

Connect dots the GM can't see from tables alone. Draw from:

- **Multi-week trajectory** — Is this an inflection point, a continuation, or a plateau? The direction matters more than the single-week number.
- **Cross-metric tension** — Sales up but labor efficiency down? Strong reviews but declining check averages? The interesting story is where two metrics disagree.
- **Labor balance** — Both over AND under guideline matter (see Labor section below).
- **Review trends** — A single bad week isn't a crisis, but 2–3 weeks of decline is a pattern (see Reviews section below).

**What NOT to include**: Don't restate numbers that appear in any table in the report. The GM can read those. Only reference specific data when it reveals something the tables don't show (e.g., "Wednesday alone was 60% of your overage" — that day-level concentration isn't obvious from the weekly total).

### Beat 3: The Ask (1 sentence)

One specific, actionable priority for the coming week.

Rules:
- **Name the day or area** — "Review labor scheduling on Wednesday" not "Watch labor"
- **Be directional, not overly prescriptive** — Don't tell the GM exactly how many shifts to cut or add. They know their store. Point them to the problem.
- **Tie to a dollar amount when possible** — "Bringing Thursday in line saves ~$280/week"
- **Never suggest sending people home early or cutting shifts reactively** — focus on *scheduling* changes for *next week*

## Headline Priority Order

Use this to decide what leads:

1. **Trend inflection** — A reversal in trajectory (3+ weeks up then a sharp drop, or a sustained climb after weeks of decline). Always the most compelling story.
2. **Momentum streak** — 3+ weeks of consecutive growth or decline. Name the streak length. Ground historically when possible ("since October"), otherwise keep it simple ("keep up the momentum!").
3. **Multi-month milestone** — Store hits its highest sales week since a named month, even without a streak (important for stores with negative comps but an improving trajectory).
4. **Labor alarm (OVER)** — Actual hours exceed guideline by >10% on any single day.
5. **Labor alarm (UNDER)** — Actual hours below 93% of guideline for the week (see Labor section).
6. **Review trend** — 2+ weeks of declining ratings or volume across platforms.
7. **Catering red flag** — $0 catering week, or catering masking a dine-in decline.
8. **Revenue efficiency shift** — SPLH moving >5% WoW.
9. **Sales milestone** — Breaking a threshold or hitting a comp target.

If nothing dramatic happened, lead with the **cross-metric tension** — where two KPIs tell different stories.

## Data Sources for GM Message

### Historical Weekly Sales (~6 months)

Pull weekly sales for the location going back approximately 26 weeks. Used for:
- **Streak calculation**: Count consecutive weeks of growth/decline walking backward from current week
- **Milestone grounding**: Find the last time sales were at or above the current week's level → "Strongest week since {month}"
- **Streak comparison**: Find the last time a streak of equal or greater length occurred → "Longest positive run since {month}"

Exclude obvious holiday/partial weeks (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's) from streak logic if they cause false breaks.

## Labor Callouts — Three Tiers

### Tier 1: Under Guideline (< 93%)

Running significantly UNDER guideline is not always good news — it can signal understaffing.

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **Actual < 93% of guideline** | "Labor came in at 92% of guideline — that's X hours of staffing capacity below target." |
| **Under guideline + declining reviews** | Critical combo. "Review scores have slipped in the same stretch, which often signals the team is being stretched thin at peak hours." |
| **Under guideline + high SPLH (>$65)** | "SPLH hit $75, which looks efficient on paper but may be pushing your team too hard during peak dayparts." |

**Key principle**: Under-guideline labor paired with declining reviews is a bigger red flag than moderate over-guideline labor with strong reviews.

### Tier 2: Moderate Over Guideline (100–105%, worst day 8+ hrs over)

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **100–105% of guideline, one day 8+ hrs over** | "Labor ran slightly over guideline at 103% — {Day} was the biggest contributor. Worth reviewing that day's scheduling for next week." |

### Tier 3: Significant Over Guideline (> 105%, worst day 10+ hrs over)

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **> 105% of guideline, one day 10+ hrs over** | "{Day} ran X hours over guideline on just Y% of weekly revenue — that's where the margin leak is." |

---

## Review Callouts — Trend-Based

Single-week ratings fluctuate — the message should focus on **multi-week patterns**, not isolated scores.

### When to Call Out Reviews

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **2+ weeks of declining ratings on any platform** | "Google reviews have trended down 3 straight weeks (5.0 → 4.5 → 4.0) — that's a pattern, not noise." |
| **Review volume drop (2+ weeks declining)** | "Ovation survey volume has dropped multiple weeks running — make sure the team is still prompting guests for feedback." |
| **Platform divergence** | "Google is at 3.6 while Ovation is at 4.6 — that gap usually means takeout/delivery is underperforming while dine-in holds up." |
| **Rating below 4.0 on Google for 2+ weeks** | Sustained low Google ratings directly impact discoverability and new customer acquisition. |

### When NOT to Call Out Reviews
- A single-week dip with low sample size (e.g., one 3-star Google review pulling the average down)
- Ratings that are steady and unremarkable week-over-week
- Minor fluctuations within the 4.0–5.0 range with no clear trend

---

## Catering Callouts

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **$0 catering week** | Most important callout. Name it directly — "No catering orders booked this week — that's incremental revenue being left on the table every week it stays at zero." |
| **Catering carrying the comp** | Critical insight when catering masks a dine-in decline — "Catering accounted for the bulk of your YoY sales gain — strip it out and dine-in growth looks much thinner." |
| **Catering trending down** | 2+ consecutive weeks of decline or significantly below PY. |
| **Catering spike** | Use as a positive anchor. |
| **Orders up, revenue flat** | Shrinking average order size — mix shift signal. |

---

## Tone

Think of the voice as a **sharp, supportive district manager** who just looked at the numbers on Sunday night. Not corporate. Not cheerful. Not cold. Direct, informed, and on your side.

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| "Great work this week!" | *(skip it — if numbers are good, the GM knows)* |
| "As you can see from the data..." | *(they can see it — tell them what it means)* |
| "Consider reviewing your labor allocation" | "Review Wednesday scheduling — that's where most of the overage is" |
| "Sales showed positive momentum" | "Strongest sales week since October" |
| "Keep up the great work" | "Keep this momentum going — protect your peak-day staffing levels" |

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **The Recap** — Restating numbers from the report. If they can read it in a table, don't write it in the message.
- **The Cheerleader** — "Amazing week! Your team crushed it!" Erodes trust.
- **The Laundry List** — "Focus on labor, reviews, and catering outreach." Three priorities = zero priorities.
- **The Hedge** — "You might want to consider possibly..." Be direct.
- **The Robot** — "Week-over-week sales increased by 4.2% while labor utilization exceeded target parameters."
- **The Comp Trap** — Leading with "negative comps" or "positive comps" without checking the multi-week trajectory. A store on its best run in months should not get a "challenging week" headline just because PY was higher.
- **The Single-Week Snapshot** — Drawing conclusions from one week of reviews. Always look at the trend before making a callout.
- **The Data Window** — Saying "in our data" or "in the trailing period." If you can't ground it historically, keep it simple and forward-looking.
- **The Micromanager** — Don't tell the GM exactly how many shifts to pull or add. Say "review Wednesday scheduling," not "pull one overlap shift from Wednesday."

## Examples

### Negative Comps but Multi-Month High
> "Strongest sales week since December at $52.7K — PY comps are still negative but the momentum this week is real. Labor came in at 92% of guideline — that's 63 hours of staffing capacity below target. SPLH hit $75, which looks efficient on paper but may be pushing your team too hard during peak dayparts. Keep this momentum going — protect your peak-day staffing levels and keep scheduling tight to guideline."

### Growth Streak (historically grounded)
> "4 straight weeks of sales growth — your longest positive run since September. Labor ran slightly over guideline at 103% — Tuesday was the biggest contributor. Worth reviewing that day's scheduling for next week. Priority for next week: review Tuesday scheduling — tightening that one day brings the week closer to guideline."

### Growth Streak (newer store, no historical reference available)
> "4 straight weeks of sales growth — keep up the momentum! No catering orders booked this week — that's incremental revenue being left on the table every week it stays at zero. Priority for next week: have your team reach out to 3 local businesses or repeat catering accounts and lock in at least one order."

### Catering Masking Dine-In
> "Solid week at $145K with comps at +4.3% — execution was clean across the board. Catering accounted for the bulk of your YoY sales gain — strip it out and dine-in growth looks much thinner. Keep this momentum going — protect your peak-day staffing levels and keep scheduling tight to guideline."

## Broad vs Single-Day Labor Overage

When multiple days run over guideline, don't just name the worst day — call out the pattern.

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **3+ of 6 operating days ran 8+ hrs over guideline (moderate, 100–105%)** | "Labor ran over guideline on X of 6 operating days — worth reviewing the full week's scheduling template rather than just one day." |
| **3+ of 6 operating days ran 8+ hrs over guideline (significant, >105%)** | "Labor ran over guideline on X of 6 operating days — this isn't a single-day scheduling miss, it's a broader staffing pattern that needs a full-week review." |
| **Only 1–2 days over** | Name the specific day(s) as before. |

**Key principle**: When the overage is spread across most of the week, the Ask should point to a full scheduling template review, not a single day.
