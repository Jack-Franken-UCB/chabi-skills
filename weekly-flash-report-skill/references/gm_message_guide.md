# Message to GM — Enhanced Writing Guide

## The Problem with the Current Approach

The existing guide asks for 4–6 insight-driven sentences. That's a solid foundation, but it produces messages that tend to read like a data summary with a suggestion tacked on. GMs skim these in 10 seconds on a Monday morning. The message needs to **land a punch in those 10 seconds** — not recap what the report already shows.

---

## The New Framework: **Headline → Story → Ask**

Every GM message should follow a three-beat structure:

### Beat 1: The Headline (1 sentence)
Open with the **single most important thing** the GM needs to know this week. This isn't a sales number — it's a *narrative shift* or a *tension point*.

| ❌ Weak opener | ✅ Strong opener |
|---|---|
| "Sales were up 4.2% this week." | "Your team just strung together 3 straight weeks of growth — first time since September." |
| "Labor was over guideline." | "Wednesday alone accounted for 60% of your total labor overage this week." |
| "Google reviews dipped slightly." | "Two 1-star reviews in 4 days is unusual for your store — worth a closer look." |

**Why this works:** The GM already *sees* the numbers. The headline reframes the data into something they need to *react to*. It creates stakes.

### Beat 2: The Story (2–3 sentences)
Connect the dots the GM can't see from the tables alone. This is where you add:

- **Trend context** — Is this an inflection point or a continuation? Compare to the prior 3–4 weeks, not just last week.
- **Cross-metric tension** — Sales up but labor efficiency down? Strong reviews but declining check averages? The interesting story is almost always where two metrics disagree.
- **Day-level specificity** — Don't say "labor was high." Say *which day*, *how much over*, and *what it cost relative to sales that day*. GMs manage in days, not weeks.

Example:
> "Sales momentum is real — you've outpaced prior year 3 of the last 4 weeks. But your Wednesday and Thursday labor is eating into the gains: those two days ran a combined 84 hours over guideline while only generating 22% of weekly revenue. Your revenue per labor hour dropped from $48.60 to $44.10 as a result."

### Beat 3: The Ask (1 sentence)
End with **one specific, actionable priority** for the coming week. The key word is *one*. Not three things to "keep an eye on." One thing to *do*.

Rules for the Ask:
- **Name the day or daypart** — "Tighten Wednesday mid-shift" not "Watch labor"
- **Be prescriptive, not diagnostic** — "Cut one overlap shift on Thursday open" not "Review Thursday staffing"
- **Tie it to a dollar amount when possible** — "Bringing Thursday in line saves ~$280/week" gives the GM a reason to act
- **Never suggest sending people home early or cutting shifts reactively** — focus on *scheduling* changes for *next week*

## Tone Calibration

Think of the voice as a **sharp, supportive district manager** who just looked at the numbers on Sunday night. Not corporate. Not cheerful. Not cold. Direct, informed, and on your side.

| Avoid | Use instead |
|---|---|
| "Great work this week!" | *(just skip it — if the numbers are good, the GM knows)* |
| "As you can see from the data..." | *(they can see it — tell them what it means)* |
| "Consider reviewing your labor allocation" | "Pull one opener from Wednesday — you're double-covered until 11am" |
| "Sales showed positive momentum" | "4th straight week above prior year — your strongest run since Q3" |
| "Keep up the great work" | *(end with a forward-looking action, not a pat on the back)* |

## Catering Callouts

Catering is a high-margin, high-leverage line item that most GMs under-manage. The report pulls 4 weeks of catering revenue and order count with prior-year comps — use that data to make catering a recurring thread in the message, not an afterthought.

### When to Call Out Catering

| Trigger | What to say |
|---|---|
| **Catering = $0 this week** | This is the most important catering callout. A zero-catering week is a missed opportunity — name it directly. "No catering orders this week — that's revenue left on the table. Even one $300 order would have added a full percentage point to your weekly comp." |
| **Catering trending down** | 2+ consecutive weeks of decline or significantly below prior year. "Catering has dropped 3 straight weeks — down from $1,800 to $640. Worth a push on local outreach this week." |
| **Catering spike** | A big week relative to recent trend. Use it as a positive anchor. "Catering drove $2,100 this week — your strongest in a month. That single line item accounted for nearly half your YoY sales gain." |
| **Catering carrying the comp** | When catering is masking a dine-in/takeout decline. This is a critical insight. "Your 3.1% comp looks solid on the surface, but $1,400 of it came from catering — dine-in was actually down 2.8%. Don't let a good catering week hide a traffic problem." |
| **Catering orders up, revenue flat** | Smaller average order size — could signal a mix shift. "You had 6 catering orders this week vs. 3 last week, but total catering revenue barely moved — average order dropped from $480 to $260. Might be worth reviewing your catering menu pricing or upsell prompts." |

### How to Weave Catering into the Three Beats

Catering rarely *is* the headline — but it's often the **Story beat** that connects the dots:

- **In Beat 1 (Headline):** Only lead with catering if it's a $0 week during what should be a strong period, or if a single large catering order is masking broader weakness.
- **In Beat 2 (Story):** This is where catering shines. Use it to explain *why* the topline number looks the way it does. "Sales were up 5%, but strip out a $1,600 catering order and you're actually flat."
- **In Beat 3 (Ask):** If catering has been absent or declining, make the ask catering-specific. "Priority for next week: lock in at least one catering order. Your team hasn't booked one in two weeks."

### What NOT to Do with Catering
- Don't mention catering if it's steady and unremarkable — not every week needs a catering note
- Don't praise a good catering week without checking if it's masking dine-in softness
- Don't suggest vague "catering outreach" — be specific: "push local office and church group orders" or "follow up on repeat catering accounts"

## Decision Logic: What's the Headline?

Use this priority order to pick your opener:

1. **Streak or inflection** — 3+ weeks of consecutive growth/decline, or a reversal of a trend. This is always the most compelling story.
2. **Labor alarm** — If actual hours exceed guideline by >10% on any single day, that's your headline. GMs can fix this fastest.
3. **Review crisis** — Any rating below 3.5, or 2+ negative reviews in the week. Reputational risk demands attention.
4. **Catering red flag** — A $0 catering week, or catering masking a dine-in decline. These are high-leverage insights GMs miss.
5. **Revenue efficiency shift** — Revenue per labor hour moving >5% WoW. This is the synthesis metric that tells the real story.
6. **Sales milestone** — Breaking a threshold (e.g., first $30K week) or hitting a comp target.

If nothing dramatic happened, lead with the **cross-metric tension** — the place where two KPIs tell different stories.

## Examples by Scenario

### Strong Week, Clean Labor
> "This is your 3rd consecutive week above prior year — the longest growth streak since August. Your team ran just 12 hours over guideline for the week, and revenue per labor hour climbed to $51.20, your best mark in 6 weeks. With this momentum, the priority for next week is protecting Friday/Saturday staffing levels — those two days drove 44% of revenue and any callouts there would hit disproportionately hard."

### Sales Up, Labor Out of Control
> "Sales were solid at $27.4K, but Wednesday and Thursday labor wiped out the margin gains — those two days ran a combined 91 hours over guideline on just $8.1K in revenue. Your weekly revenue per labor hour dropped to $41.80, down from $46.50 last week. For next week, look at pulling one mid-shift overlap on both days — bringing those two days to guideline alone would recover roughly $350 in labor cost."

### Declining Sales, Tight Labor
> "This marks the 2nd straight week of declining same-store sales, down 6.3% vs. prior year. The good news: your labor discipline is strong at just 4 hours over guideline for the week, keeping revenue per labor hour at a respectable $47.10. The priority now is traffic — your check average actually rose 3% this week, so the gap is in guest count, not spend. Worth reviewing whether any local marketing or catering pushes can target the slower midweek days."

### Good Comp Hiding a Dine-In Problem (Catering Mask)
> "Your 4.8% comp looks strong, but dig in and the story shifts — a single $1,900 catering order drove almost all of the YoY gain. Strip that out and dine-in was actually down 1.2% for the 2nd straight week. Catering is great when it comes, but it's not predictable enough to carry the store. Priority this week: focus on midweek dine-in traffic — your Tuesday and Wednesday guest counts have dropped 3 of the last 4 weeks."

### Zero Catering Week
> "No catering orders booked this week — that's the 2nd time in 3 weeks. At your store's average catering ticket of ~$450, even one order would have flipped your comp from -1.1% to positive. Labor was well managed at just 8 hours over guideline, so the margin structure is there — you just need the topline. For next week, have your team reach out to 3 repeat catering accounts and lock in at least one order."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **The Recap** — Restating numbers from the report. If they can read it in a table, don't write it in the message.
- **The Cheerleader** — "Amazing week! Your team crushed it!" This erodes trust. Let strong numbers speak for themselves.
- **The Laundry List** — "Focus on labor, reviews, and catering outreach." Three priorities = zero priorities.
- **The Hedge** — "You might want to consider possibly looking into..." Be direct. GMs respect clarity.
- **The Robot** — "Week-over-week sales increased by 4.2% while labor utilization exceeded target parameters." Write like a human.
